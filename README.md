dotemacs
========

My emacs config. Intended for use with emacs 24.*

Installation
============

* Run ./install.sh. You will be prompted to overwrite or backup if previous configs exist
* Open Emacs and load ~/.emacs.d/init.el into the buffer
* Run ```M-X package-install [RET] better-defaults```
* Run ```M-X eval-buffer```

NOTE: I don't know why you have to manually install ```better-defaults``` for now and don't have time to figure it out :)
